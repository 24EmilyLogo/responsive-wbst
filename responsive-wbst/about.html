        <h2>Join Crew 479!</h2>
        <p>
            Venturing Crew 479 was originally established as Exploring Post 479 in November 1992, and 
            became Venturing Crew 479 in 1999 when Boy Scouts of America(BSA) first established the Venturing program. 
            We recruit and welcome new youth into the crew every year. 
            If you're interested in joining, feel free to contact us through the contact tab.

        <h2>What is Venturing?</h2>
        <p>
            Venturing is one of the many programs of the BSA and is for people in or entering high school.
            Venturing is broken up by Crews, these crews do many different things. 
            Crews do anything from chilling and playing games to high-adventure. 
            If you can think of a school appropriate activity, 
            there's probably a crew for it.
