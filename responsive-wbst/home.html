        <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Venturing Crew 479! Our Crew is an outdoor activities club. 
            We are sponsored by the Rotary Club of Cupertino and 
            affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America's(BSA) Venturing program.<br>
            Venturing is the young-adult, high-adventure program of the BSA. 
            It is co-educational and 
            includes youth from the age of 14 (or 13 and completed 8th grade) to the age of 20.<br>
            Crew 479 focuses on exciting outdoor experiences like 
            skiing, biking, climbing, rafting, and backpacking.
            Just look at some of the great places we've been and the cool things we've done!
